Isaac Khor is a programming, music, philosophy, and mathematics enthusiast. This blog is a merely a collection of his ramblings.

## Contact

If you don't know me personally or know somebody that does, the easiest way of contacting me is via email (It's an image because I'm pretty sure spambot crawlers don't do OCR):

![Email address](/img/contact.png)

This is the response time that I strive to achieve given the method of communication:

1. Phone number: one hour
2. People already in my contacts: one day
3. Social media & the email shown above: 3 days

Add a day if the reply takes a long time to compose.
