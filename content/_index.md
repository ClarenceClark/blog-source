My name is Isaac Khor, and I've been writing software, both big and small,
since 2012. I have experience in most major areas of software engineering,
from embedded programming, time-sensitive networking, to building blog engines
in Go and backend infrastructure in clojure.

Look below for the projects I've worked on before.
