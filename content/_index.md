My name is Isaac Khor, and I've been writing software, both big and small,
since 2012. I have experience in most major areas of software engineering,
from embedded programming, time-sensitive networking, to building blog engines
in Go and backend infrastructure in clojure.

Look below for the public projects I've worked on before.

### Projects

[**Project Clarentine**](/projects/project-clarentine/)
([Github](https://github.com/IsaacKhor/project-clarentine/)) - My attempt at
building a calendar not on any astronomical phenomena or religion but instead
on regular repeating seasons of 144 days and cycles of 12 days. I'll be
extremely surprised if there's anybody other than me using it.

[**Better FF Reader**](/projects/better-ff-reader/) 
([Github](https://github.com/IsaacKhor/better-ff-reader/)) - A customisable 
reader mode for Firefox.

[**Tridactyl**](https://github.com/cmcaine/tridactyl) - A vim interface for
Firefox. A successor to vimperator (may it rest in peace).

[**CljTinyC**](https://github.com/IsaacKhor/cljtinyc) - An incomplete C compiler
written in clojure for my compilers course.

[**LinuxPTP**](http://linuxptp.sourceforge.net/) - An implementation of the
Precision Time Protocol (PTP) on linux.

**Autograder for Clark CS Courses** - I am in charge of Clark's autograding
infrastructure for several CS courses. Email me to request access to the repo.
