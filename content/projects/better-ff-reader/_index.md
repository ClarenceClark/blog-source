## Better Firefox Reader

{{< figure src="reader-mode-screenshot.png" title="Reader mode screenshot." >}}

This Firefox extension adds a toolbar that functions just like the built-in reader mode.

If parsing fails for some reason, it's not my fault but Mozilla's, because I am using the same parsing engine (found [here](https://github.com/mozilla/readability)) as Firefox.

Please report bugs [here](https://github.com/ClarenceClark/better-ff-reader/issues). The review section is not a bug management site.

Features:

 - Auto-enforce list: a list of urls that will have the reader mode automatically enable
 - Custom CSS: inject custom CSS

Download:

 - [Mozilla Addons (AMO)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/better-ff-reader/)
