I used to spend a significant part of my day arguing online with other people about the merits of various schools of philosophy.

Over time, however, a question kept surfacing in my thoughts: just _why_ does any of this _matter_? Why do I care if reality is fundamentally material or immaterial (idealism v materialism)? Why do I care if mind is separate from matter (dualism v monism)? Why does any of this matter?

Of course this matters, you exclaim. Is it not important to know whether reality is fundamentally material? 

But then, I came across the concept of _Bayesian_ rationality. The fundamental axiom for my thinking can be stated as such: that which cannot be statistically proven does not concern me.

And so I realised that all the time I spent on metaphysics was in vain. 

Metaphysics, by definition, deals with that which is _beyond_ physics. As soon as something _can_ be proven using statistical science, it _leaves the realm of metaphysics and enters the realm of real, actual, physics_.

Simply said: as long as a theory within the realm of metaphysics, there is _no point in arguing for it_. We may one day determine a method of testing the link between consciousness and information processing; until such a day arrives, the debate over the mind-body problem will remain within the realm of philosophy and not science.

_Theories make verifiable predictions_. This is the fundamental axiom of Bayesian rationality. If my theory T predicts outcome A, and Â¬A (not A) occurs, then my confidence in T diminished proportional to my pre-existing confidence (if I wasn't sure of the theory in the first place, then my confidence diminishes much less than if I was absolutely sure that T is correct and A would happen).

The debate between idealism and materialism _predicts the same outcome_, namely that absolutely nothing would change. Apples will still fall from trees and light will still travel at _c_; _there exists no observation that can increase or decrease my confidence in the theory_. 

What I have realised is that it _doesn't matter_ if the world is fundamentally material or immaterial, or even if these concepts are valid at all. Clocks will still tick, computers will still run -- the world continues with no difference. The knowledge that idealism or materialism is true _holds no predictive power_ -- that is to say -- you can make a decision based on the knowledge that one of the theories is true.

The same hold for the mind-body problem. Assuming that the theory of Dualism, as advocated by Descartes, is correct, what _predictions_ can it make? How will the world be different if it is true, compared to if some sort of physicalism is true? A world where dualism or another where some form of monism is true is no _behaviourally_ different: that is to say, we cannot _observe_ anything different.

Ever since this realisation, philosophy has lost much of its appeal. I simply no longer _care_ when somebody makes an impassioned plea for one school of thought or another -- it doesn't matter who is right -- it is simply _irrelevant_.
